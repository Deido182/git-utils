Given the reference ```ref``` of a commit <b>on the current branch</b>, ```git changemessage <ref> <new-message>``` replaces its message with ```<new-message>```. The whole list of commits with their ```refs``` can be retrieved by ```git log```. Otherwise, you can directly use ```HEAD~<n>``` as well (where ```HEAD~1``` is the penultimate commit).
