```git ismergedinto [-b <source>] <dest>``` returns ```true``` if  ```<source>``` (or the current branch, if not specified) has already been merged into ```<dest>```, or ```false``` otherwise.
Alternatively, ```git ismergedinto -l [-b <source>]``` returns the whole list of branches the ```<source>``` (or the current branch, if not specified) is merged into.
